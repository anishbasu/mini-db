File Format:

There are 2 files:
<name>.meta - This stores the table metadata for the database
<name>.db - This stores the row information for the database

Each row is has a pack/unpack function for serialization. They are self contained, and support generics.
The structs are written to memory first before being written to the disk.


Table Struct Packing:
table size|name|field types|address of first row

Row Struct Packing:
row size|field types|fields

Strings are contained both ways, with preceeding sizes and a null terminator.

Running:
Run make to compile the code and then use `./mini <dbname>` to create a new database and interactive session.

A few demo SQL queries are present in test_sql.sql

NOTES:
I'm sorry this code isn't well commented. I spent a lot of time working with it and still had to finish a big part of it on Sunday.

However, I am glad the database works as I wanted to and has a lot of error checking, especially in the SQL syntax. Check out the lexer and parser for some LL(1) fun.
